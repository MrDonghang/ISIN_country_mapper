# ISIN_country_mapper
When dealing with corporate financial data, it is common to encounter the need to match a companyâ€™s ISIN code to its corresponding country. This function solves the problem by converting ISIN codes into ISO three-letter country codes, making it more convenient to use. 

By converting to ISO 3-letter country codes, you can also link this data with other external geographic datasets for geographic analysis.
